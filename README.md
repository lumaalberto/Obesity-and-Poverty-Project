# Obesity-and-Poverty-Project
Are poverty and obesity associated? 
  Poverty rates and obesity were reviewed across all 51 states in the U.S. In contrast to 
  international trends, people in America who live in the most poverty-dense counties are those 
  most prone to obesity. States with poverty rates of greater than 35% have obesity rates 145% 
  greater than wealthy counties. 
  
How is poverty linked to obesity? 
  I will prove that individuals who live in impoverished regions have poor access to fresh food. 
  Poverty-dense areas are oftentimes called “food deserts,” implying diminished access to fresh 
  food. 
  I will also prove the evidence of the association between sedentariness, poor health, obesity, 
  diabetes, other metabolic diseases, and premature death. Sedentary individuals move 2 hours 
  per day less than active individuals and expend less energy, and they are thereby prone to 
  obesity, chronic metabolic disease, and cardiovascular death.
  
What can be done to solve the obesity problem? 
  I will create focus on predictive analysis to pinpoint a diverse set of physical activities and 
  nutritional programs in neighborhoods and educational institutions may be the best way to 
  reduce the risk of obesity among poor youngsters. I will also some such that need reliable 
  Association Between Poverty and Obesity in the United States 
  funding from governments and charities to boost and leverage valuable programs in 
  neighborhood centers and schools serving disadvantaged Americans.
